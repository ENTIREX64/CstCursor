# Hello Curious visitors
It seems to come stubbled upon my little project...
And what is it?

## Introduction and Features
this is a small project, showcasing a very cool custom cursor I made.  
- It's just a simpler custom cursor
- It becomes bigger and inverts the color of the text when it hovers over the text

## Running this project
- It is available online at [entirex64.github.io/CstCursor](https://entirex64.github.io/CstCursor/)
- You can also just download the zip and open the index.html

## How I made it
- Basic CSS
- VScode (code editor)

## Acknowledgments
- StackOverflow: we all use it
- VScode: its the best
- And you (ðŸ’–) too
